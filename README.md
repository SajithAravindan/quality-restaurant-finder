# Quality Restaurant Finder (QRF)
A dashboard that allows a user to input their address, state, and town/city to retrieve restaurants located in their area.

## Description
- Using Tailwind CSS, the website was designed for easy functionality as well as improving the overall appearance of the site!
- By using a restaurant finder API, data is extracted from the API and added to a local restaurant informational so it can display things that a user would search for.
- Adding in a google API, the distance between the location of the user's address input and a restaurant could be calculated, so a user is aware of just how long a drive a restaurant is from their house.
- Through this activity, we gained more knowledge on API usage, how to use a whole new type of CSS framework, and how to work together as a team with git, sharing information and ideas, and making a fully functional website!
